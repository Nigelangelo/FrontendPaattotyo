# Pokedex

## Frontend lopputy√∂ HTK22S1. <br>

## Frontend courses tasks final assignment, which was done with Svelte.

### Made by Niko Jokikokko

### The idea

The idea comes from Pokemon animes, frequently seen Pokedex.<br>
Pokedex was mine, as was many others, fever dream toy as a child, and wanted to try to create similar website to fulfill the purpose.<br>
This project might have been a bit too much for me, and ended up being, in all honesty, pretty bad, but hey it's all up from here!
